# Toilet Paper Recognition
There have been many controversies over the direction of toilet paper when it is hung on. Although some very early patent implies that the <i>over</i> direction is right<a href = "https://www.businessinsider.com/patent-shows-right-way-to-hang-toilet-paper-2015-3">[1]</a>, even today, many tissues all around the world are being hung in various directionsâ€•even sometimes it hung on vertically. 

So, we developers decided to make a fully automatic program based on convolutional neural network to detect the direction the tissue in the picture is hung. And some convenient UI that helps users to upload the pictures that may contain toilet tissues so that this program can detect on. And here is what we made.
